#Clone# 
First, clone a repository

The Getting Started project is a simple GitHub repository which contains everything you need to build an image and run it as a container.

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you donâ€™t have it already.

>>> 'git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started.git'


#Build# 
Now, build the image

A Docker image is a private file system just for your container. It provides all the files and code your container needs.

>>> 'cd getting-started'
>>> 'docker build -t docker101tutorial .'


#Run#
Run your first container

Start a container based on the image you built in the previous step. Running a container launches your application with private resources, securely isolated from the rest of your machine.

>>> 'docker run -d -p 80:80 --name docker-tutorial docker101tutorial'


#Share#
Now save and share your image

Save and share your image on Docker Hub to enable other users to easily download and run the image on any destination machine.

>>> 'docker tag docker101tutorial sibalex/docker101tutorial'
>>> 'docker push <your_dockerHub_Id>/docker101tutorial'
